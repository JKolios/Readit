Redit Trend Logger

Retrieves the top 50 submissions across all subreddits of reddit.com and compares this list to one previously stored.
The variation of link karma scores between the lists is noted in a text report file.

Mostly a Python coding exercise, not meant for any real-world use.

Uses Deimos's python wrapper for the Reddit API (https://github.com/Deimos/reddit_api).
